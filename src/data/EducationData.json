These include (but are not limited to), standards for:\n   • Data/result files and their associated contextual metadata - e.g. minimum reporting requirements, terminologies (controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies), or file formats or conceptual models;\n    • Analysis - e.g., standardised descriptions of the software used and workflow descriptions;\n   • Code and algorithms that are employed, or software that has been developed- e.g., open version repositories and documentation; and\n   • The relationship between interpretations and conclusions to other digital concepts - e.g., through standardised bibliographic resources such as PubMed, but also via citation principles and practices for data and other research objects.\nThe perspective and focus of these standards varies, including\n   • a specific scientific significance, or domain of study - e.g., neuroscience, stem cell,\n   • the technology used to generate the datasets - e.g., imaging modality, mass spectrometry.\nThe motivations for the development of these standards span a wide area, for example the creation of de novo standards to fill an existing gap, the mapping and harmonisation of complementary or contrasting efforts, and the extension and repurposing of existing standards.\n(Source: <a href='https://isa-tools.org/archived/' target='_blank' class='underline-effect'>Sansone et al., 2013</a>)"

Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR principles put a specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use data or any digital object, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. Standards for the description, interoperability, citation etc. are at the core of these principles. As one of the groups facilitating the implementation of the FAIR principles, FAIRsharing abides by these principles and ensures that standards, as a type of digital object, are also Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible.

          "desc": "Standards for data and their associated contextual/experimental metadata (essentially, data about the data) are also known as data standards, metadata standards or content standards. FAIRsharing currently focuses on 4 standard subtypes:\n    • Reporting guidelines or checklists outline the minimum information that should be reported alongside a experiment or dataset in order to place it into context. These vary from general guidance to itemised prescriptions of the information that should be provided, both in terms of data and associated metadata.\n    • Models/formats or syntax - define the representation of information from a conceptual model or schema, and the transmission format, such as XML, CSV or RDF, which facilitate information exchange.\n    • Terminology artefacts encompass controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or ontologies and add an interpretive/translational layer (beyond any that might be provided by the syntax), and enable complex hierarchical grouping and querying of the data.\n  • Identifier schemata are formal systems for resources and other digital objects that allow their unique and unambiguous identification.\nAcross the wider research community there are many different ways to categorise and name data/metadata standards, and even to define what constitutes a standard. Nevertheless, in FAIRsharing we will progressively add more types and subtypes as required by the community to ensure wider coverage. For example, one possibility is the addition of Common Data Elements (CDEs). These are particularly used in biomedicine as there are often data elements that are common to multiple data sets across different studies."

Each are interested in different aspects of a particular standard and play different roles (e.g. provide use cases to inform the development of standards, implement in tools, endorse in policies) in different phases of its life cycle. The way these standardisation groups are organised also varies by organisation type, level of formality (e.g. some are legal entities, while the majority are ad hoc working groups), membership types (open and free, members only), operational approaches, and funding. The majority of grass-root efforts are either unfunded or minimally funded. Awareness of which groups are doing what is vital to a coordinated approach; and, since the activities of any group changes over time, such awareness must be continually updated.

Therefore, if we are to realise their potential, we must avoid re-invention, as unnecessary division and fragmentation of standards may result in incompatibility, which only adds to the challenges we face. Consequently, joining an existing effort must be the first option, to e.g. fill gaps in coverage, propose extensions or even repurpose an existing standard. Of course, considering the complexity of the general standard life cycle, the choice may not be so simple. If creating a new initiative is the most appropriate option, first and foremost be aware of the challenges ahead, then make an effort to link to related efforts, to ensure complementarity, propose mapping, conversions or harmonisation of complementary or contrasting efforts.

          "desc": "There are several issues one needs to be aware of, depending if you are producer or consumer of standards. There is no simple answer, but here are some key points. There is no central authority for standards, or at least one that is recognised by all the parties involved; standards are fragmented, there are unnecessary duplications and gaps. If you create a standard, be aware that each step of the standards life cycle has both social and technical challenges. Extensive community liaison and stakeholder communication need to be managed and funded; rewards and incentives need to be identified for all contributors; invaluable feedback cycles need to be recorded, and the complex unpacking of stakeholders’ dynamics needs to be unpacked. These are all demanding tasks. Ownership of open standards can also be problematic, the legal framework to encourage their maintenance, contribution and evolution is very embryonic.\nIf you are a consumer of standards then you may not always be equipped to navigate, select or recommend the most appropriate standards, or you may come face-to-face with a dearth of domain-specific efforts, and see standards as burdensome and/or over-prescriptive. Implementing standards in tools/databases for ‘invisible use’, as it should be, is also not a trivial task. Developing data-related policies is also challenging. Policy makers often may not have the evidence to make informed decisions on which standards and/or databases they should recommended, to support data sharing, preservation and interoperability. Lastly, appropriate funding mechanisms are very rarely provided to support both the production and use of standards. As one may imagine, the challenges surrounding data/metadata standards extend well beyond these points.\nHowever, every challenge is an opportunity, and FAIRsharing is here to help all standard producers and users get the best out of data/metadata standards.\n(Source: <a href='http://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-1-10' target='_blank' class='underline-effect'>Sansone and Rocca-Serra, 2012</a>)"

FAIRsharing fulfills the essential job of mapping this dynamic landscape and in doing so helps a variety of users in their tasks. Examples include:\n    • Researchers - to find journals that meet their funder requirements, journal standards, the specific needs for a data management plan, and to enable their data to be shared as widely as possible (as per funding and publication requirements).\n    • Publishers - to link from journals to repositories that meet the requirements as set down by their data policies and to meet any necessary content standards.\n    • Funders - to understand which journals and repositories meet their policies, and to provide knowledge of the current landscape of community-defined standards and databases to refine their recommendations.\n    • Developers and curators of repositories and standards - to ensure their products are discoverable and well described so they can be: evaluated and recommended by journals and funders in their policies; used by researchers to meet their funder policies and the policies of the journals they wish to publish in; and reused and/or extended by other developers and curators, according to the products’ licence, to meet their specific needs.\n    • Librarians to support scholars to: utilise data standards and conform to journal, institutional, and funder policies; and to develop and maintain institutional data and publication repositories."

          "desc": "Each record in FAIRsharing contains a number of indicators and descriptors. There are 2 types of indicators: a set of tags indicating the readiness of that resource for implementation or use, and links to any recommendations by journals, funders and other organisations.\n There are over 40 descriptors, grouped into sections, but not all are compulsory or indeed appropriate for every record. At the top of every record there is a URL linking to the homepage of the resource, and a short free text description. Below this, there is country and taxonomy information, curated using a controlled set of tags based on the list of country names provided by the United Nations and the NCBI Taxonomy. The research area and knowledge domains for all record types can be tagged with terms from our ontologies and controlled vocabularies. This section also contains a link to the maintainer of the record (where available). This maintainer is someone associated with the resource itself, and is able to edit and update the record directly (more information about becoming a maintainer and community curation can be found in the community curation section below). Below the top section of the record, there are a number of sections relating to the support information about the resource (e.g. tutorials, help mail, FAQs), contact details, publications, and the tools and web services available from the database. The organisation section of the record details the group or organisation behind the resource, and grant or funding information. Record metadata varies depending on the type of registry (standard, database or data policy) and record completeness varies as well, usually due to certain fields not being appropriate for certain resources (e.g. no publication associated with a database). By collating this information into one resource, and augmenting it with links among all related FAIRsharing records, FAIRsharing provides the most comprehensive catalogue of data standards, databases and data policies available today."

When we know for a fact that a resource is no longer maintained or active, the record for that resource is tagged as deprecated. We add a note to these records to give the reason for the deprecation, if known. Often, a record may be deprecated as the resource has been superseded by another resource.
