A standard provides the requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used for the description, interoperability, citation, sharing, publication, or preservation of all kinds of digital objects such as data, code, algorithms, workflows, software, or papers."

          "desc": "There are several types of standards that address different, but often complementary challenges. These include (but are not limited to), standards for:\n   • Data/result files and their associated contextual metadata - e.g. minimum reporting requirements, terminologies (controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies), or file formats or conceptual models;\n    • Analysis - e.g., standardized descriptions of the software used and workflow descriptions;\n   • Code and algorithms that are employed, or software that has been developed- e.g., open version repositories and documentation; and\n   • The relationship between interpretations and conclusions to other digital concepts - e.g., through standardized bibliographic resources such as PubMed, but also via citation principles and practices for data and other research objects.\nThe perspective and focus of these standards varies, ranging\n   • from a specific scientific significance, or domain of study - e.g., neuroscience, stem cell),\n   • to the technology used to generate the datasets - e.g., imaging modality, mass spectrometry.\nThe motivation for the development of these standards spans from the creation of de novo standards to fill an existing gap, to the mapping and harmonization of complementary or contrasting efforts, and the extension and repurposing of existing standards.\n(Source: <a href='https://isa-tools.org/archived/' target='_blank' class='underline-effect'>Sansone et al., 2013</a>)"
