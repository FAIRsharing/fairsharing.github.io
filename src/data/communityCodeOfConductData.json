Your involvement helps us to further our mission and to create an open platform that serves a broad range of communities, from research and research support, to policymakers, funders and societies/organisations."

      {
        "text": "Naturally, this implies diversity of ideas and perspectives on often complex problems. Disagreement and healthy discussion of conflicting viewpoints is welcome: the best solutions to hard problems rarely come from a single angle. Sometimes, we have a tendency to take disagreement personally and easily drift into behaviour that ultimately degrades a community. This is particularly acute with online communication across language and cultural gaps, where many cues of human behaviour are unavailable. We are outlining here a set of principles and processes to support a healthy community in the face of these challenges."

        "text": "Fundamentally, we are committed to fostering a productive, harassment-free environment for everyone. Rather than considering this code an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do, take it in the spirit it is intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate."

      {
        "text": "Importantly: as a member of our community, you are also a steward of these values. Not all problems need to be resolved via formal processes, and often a quick, friendly but clear word on an online forum or in person can help resolve a misunderstanding and de-escalate things."
      },
      {
        "text": "However, sometimes these informal processes may be inadequate: they fail to work, there is urgency or risk to someone, nobody is intervening publicly and you don’t feel comfortable speaking in public, etc. For these or other reasons, structured follow-up may be necessary and here we provide the means for that: we welcome reports by emailing <a href='mailto:contact@fairsharing.org'> contact@fairsharing.org</a> ."

Try to understand where others are coming from, as seeing a question from their viewpoint may help find a new path forward.
