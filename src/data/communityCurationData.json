Through their own knowledge and via engagement with the network of experts available on our Community Champions Slack channel, they manage and curate records within their domain of interest to increase coverage and improve the content of FAIRsharing records. Community Champions work in concert with our existing maintainer community, supplementing their efforts as well as suggesting new maintainers for the in-house FAIRsharing curation team to contact. Each record has over 40 different descriptors, which allows an accurate summary of each resource to be curated within FAIRsharing. Of particular importance to our records is the curation of the ecosystem of resources within any given domain. FAIRsharing allows the connections among standards, databases and policies to be richly described, creating a dynamic network of relationships that can be navigated by our users. Each champion is attributed for their curation efforts through their user profile pages, which display their curation activities."

They curate only those resources they are directly involved with. They form the core of our user community and create a network of collaboration that ensures our records are up to date, but more importantly promotes their resource to help it be more visible, more widely adopted and more cited. In contrast, Community Champions update and manage across an ecosystem of records within their domains of interest. They are able to access all records in their discipline as well as create new ones. Community champions help their own research domains by creating records and collections that aid resource discovery and gap analysis as well as identifying targeted outreach and engagement activities."

Community Champions have their status and domain of expertise listed in the Awards section within their user profiles. Further, as a trusted partner with ORCID, we also push this award to each Champion’s ORCID profile. Such ORCID Service items are awarded annually, as long as the Champion is active with us for at least part of the year."

During the course of their tenure, Community champions will be learning data curation at a resource-level of granularity, a skill that gives them knowledge not only about the landscape of standards and databases within their community, but how to accurately describe them. Finally, champions are asked for feedback on new features such as new educational material, certification schemes, and design choices, providing them with a voice in the direction of the project."

Disagreement and healthy discussion of conflicting viewpoints is welcome: the best solutions to hard problems rarely come from a single angle.
