Our community curators promote the standards and databases most relevant to their research domain or area of focus. They also promote their research community and ensure that the resources within that community are findable, accessible, and exposed to data management tools, knowledge graphs and other research software. As a FAIRsharing Community Curator, you can help us help your community be more accurately and comprehensively represented with us. And in return, we have a lot to offer you.",

Through their own knowledge and via engagement with the network of experts available on our Community Curation Slack channel, they will manage and curate records within their domain of interest to increase coverage and improve the content of FAIRsharing records. Community Curators work in concert with our existing maintainer community, supplementing their efforts as well as suggesting new maintainers for the in-house FAIRsharing curation team to contact. Each record has over 40 different descriptors, which allows an accurate summary of each resource to be curated within FAIRsharing. Of particular importance to our records is the curation of the ecosystem of resources within any given domain. FAIRsharing allows the connections among standards, databases and policies to be richly described, creating a dynamic network of relationships that can be navigated by our users."

They curate only those resources they are directly involved with. They form the core of our user community and create a network of collaboration that ensures our records are up to date, but more importantly promotes their resource to help it be more visible, more widely adopted and more cited. In contrast, Community Curators update and manage across an ecosystem of records within their domains of interest. They are able to access all records in their discipline as well as create new ones. Community curators help their own research domains by creating records and collections that aid resource discovery and gap analysis as well as identifying targeted outreach and engagement activities."

Community Curators have their status and domain of expertise listed in the Awards section within their user profiles. Further, as a trusted partner with ORCID, we also push this award to each Curator’s ORCID profile. Such ORCID Service items are awarded annually, as long as the Curator is active with us for at least part of the year."

During the course of their tenure, Community Curators will be learning data curation at a resource-level of granularity, a skill that gives them knowledge not only about the landscape of standards and databases within their community, but how to accurately describe them. Finally, FAIRsharing will request feedback on new features such as new educational material, certification schemes, and design choices from our Community Curators first, providing them with a voice in the direction of the project."

Disagreement and healthy discussion of conflicting viewpoints is welcome: the best solutions to hard problems rarely come from a single angle.

This is particularly acute with online communication across language and cultural gaps, where many cues of human behaviour are unavailable. We are outlining here a set of principles and processes to support a healthy community in the face of these challenges."
